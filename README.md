## Hey, I'm Tyler 👋

I sit at the intersection of technical and human — comfortable explaining mesh networking to a first-timer and running live events for 3,000 people.

**What I'm about:**
- 🏠 Running a multi-site homelab (Tailscale, Proxmox, Infrasturcture as Code)
- 🎙️ Former radio producer (200K+ listeners) and cruise ship events coordinator
- 🌏 Teaching technical topics to 2,000+ international professionals
- 🔧 Building tools to surface community sentiment at scale

**Currently exploring:** Community management, developer relations, and how to make technical products feel human.
